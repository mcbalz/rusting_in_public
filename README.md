# rusting_in_public

Rusting in public is created to house public work from my Duke Rust Fundamentals Specialization course on Coursera.

I make no pretenses to robust skills and capacities with this programming language.  
Also I have no illusions about how my rusting in public makes any sense. But in the 
spirit of cooperation I am creating this repository.
